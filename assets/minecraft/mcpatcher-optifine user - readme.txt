Dear MCPatcher/Optifine User,

If you are currently reading this simple TXT file, it's because you are probably an Optifine or MCPatcher user. If you are an Optifine use, you probably have this question: "WHY THE HELL IS THERE A MCPATCHER FOLDER AND NO OPTIFINE FOLDER?"...

You probably also have one of those questions:

1- Is the PureBDcraft (HD) ResourcePack is well optimized for Optifine as it is for MCPatcher?
2- The ResourcePack takes time to load, I don't use the "Connected Textures" feature, can I reduce the loading time?
3- Why can't I run PureBDcraft in this resolution and how can I solve this?

And maybe more questions... If so, be sure to use the Help Center on bdcraft.net (http://bdcraft.net/community/pbdc-help/)


Here are my answers to the 4 questions:

0) Because the mcpatcher folder holds all the textures for the cool features included in MCPatcher AND Optifine. YES, Optifine use the "mcpatcher" folder as MCPatcher do.

1) PureBDcraft is optimized for MCPatcher and Optifine. Infact, it's more the job of Optifine and MCPatcher to take in account the textures and files included in the "mcpatcher" folder. ;)

2) The ResourcePack takes time to load because there are many textures included in the "mcpatcher" folder for the additionnal features of MCPatcher and Optifine. To reduce the loading time, you can delete one or more folders in the "mcpatcher/ctm" folder. The "Connected Textures" feature will not work anymore for some blocks (like the Stained Clay blocks)

3) You probably can't run the current resolution because you don't have enough RAM (PC Memory) and/or VRAM (dedicated memory to the graphic-card). You can try to follow the instructions of the question 2, that could help because of less textures to load in memory.



Have fun,
